            <p class="excerpt">Web development is an ever-evolving field, and my journey into it has been both challenging and rewarding. Starting from the basics of HTML and CSS, I gradually moved on to more complex technologies like JavaScript and backend frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. Each step has been a learning curve, filled with coding, debugging, and moments of satisfaction when everything finally works as expected.

                One of the most exciting aspects of web development is the ability to bring ideas to life. Whether it's creating a simple landing page or building a complex web application, the possibilities are endless.

Every project I work on adds a new layer of understanding and helps me refine my skills.
                
                As I continue to learn, I'm also exploring new areas such as WordPress development and graphic design. These skills allow me to offer a broader range of services and create more comprehensive solutions for clients. The journey is ongoing, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next..</p>
